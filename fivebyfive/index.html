            <p> For 5 days continuous days I recreated past memories using multiple 3D softwares. I set contraints on the design by requiring myself to make them as close to real as I could based around a limited amount of time. From modeling physical structures, to sunrise and sunset I tried to recreate some of my favorite places/memories from living in the Bay area.</p>

             On the first day I did strictly 3d modeling in Maya. I 3d modeled part of the baybridge based off of google 2D images. I used the images as reference to build a similar incomplete structure of the bridge. I then used basic Arnold Materials to color and fully render.

             On day 2 I designed my commute back to SF from work. Every day for over a year I would see the sun set over Twin peaks. I 3D modeled the Sutro tower and overlayed it in front of the sunset.Every morning leaving for work and returning from work I'd see the sun over the bay.

             Day three was focused on integrating the Maya models I made into Unity. I also focused on building terrain using Unity's terrain builder tools. I referenced google maps and spent a couple of hours trying to use a paint brush to depict the hills that make up the actual area of twin peaks.

               On day four I stepped away from modeling structures to learning C#. I created a basic function that makes the sun go around based on deltaTime. That way the sun is rising and setting every couple of seconds. IT gives the illusion of sunrise/sunset
